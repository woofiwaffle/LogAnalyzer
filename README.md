# LogAnalyzer

## Input Data
### LogAnalyzer processes application log files, which typically contain:

1. `Event Timestamps:` Date and time of each event for chronological analysis.
2. `Logging Levels:` Information about the type of events, such as INFO, WARNING, and ERROR, allowing filtering by importance.
3. `Event Messages:` Main textual information describing the event and its nature.

These log files should be in a structured text format to ensure correct processing by the system.

## Analysis Output (Results)
### LogAnalyzer generates structured reports, including:

1. `CSV Reports:` Tables with analytics on event frequency, warnings, errors, and other data for in-depth analysis.
2. `Graphical Reports:` PNG diagrams and charts that visualize key metrics and trends for easier interpretation.
3. `Log Archives and Backups:` Logs are compressed and stored in a backup directory for long-term storage and potential recovery.
